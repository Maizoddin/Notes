Constructor :
* Costructor should have same name as that of class.
* Constructor should not have return type.
* Constructor should be non-static because it's an instance method.
* When there is no constructor created then compiler will create default constructor.
* Constructor can be overloaded.
* Constructor can't be final, abstract, static.
* Canstructor can have access specified but it's good to use public access specifier so it can be called from anywhere when an object is created.

Example :
package frontend;

public class Dashboard {
    String userName;
    int accountBalance;
    boolean isUserActive;

     public Dashboard(String name, int balance, boolean isActive) {
        userName = name;
        accountBalance = balance;
        isUserActive = isActive;
        displayDashBoard();
    }
    private void displayDashBoard() {
        System.out.println("Name : " + userName + "\nBalance : " + accountBalance + "\nisActive : " + isUserActive);
        RuleSet ruleSet = new RuleSet();
        ruleSet.display();
    }

}

=====================================================================

Singleton Design pattern : Only one instance of that class should be created.

Steps :
1] Class should contain private static reference variable of same class type.
2] Class should have private constructor.
3] Class should have public static methode to create and return object reference.

Example :
Dashboard.java
public class Dashboard {
    String userName;
    int accountBalance;
    boolean isUserActive;

    //    SINGLETON DESIGN PATTERN

    private static Dashboard dashboardInstance;

    private Dashboard(String name, int balance, boolean isActive) {
        userName = name;
        accountBalance = balance;
        isUserActive = isActive;
    }

    public static Dashboard getDashboardInstance(String name, int balance, boolean isActive) {
        if (dashboardInstance == null) {
            dashboardInstance = new Dashboard(name, balance, isActive);
            return dashboardInstance;
        }else {
            return null;
        }
    }

}

Main.java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dashboard dashboard = Dashboard.getDashboardInstance("Maizoddin", 10000000, true);
    }
