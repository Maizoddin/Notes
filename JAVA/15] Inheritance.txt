Inheritance :
keyword : extends

Accessibility :
Subclass can access public and protected members of superclass.
Subclass can also access default members of superclass if both are in the same package.

Types of Inheritance :
1] Single level :
   B extends A

2] Multi level :
   B extends A
   C extends B

3] Hirarchical :
   B extends A
   C extends A
   D extends A


* No multiple inheritance 


Note :
Good Practice :
Inside child class instance methode
* To access parent class instance methode use super.
* To access parent class static method use parent class name.

=====================================================================

Parent class reference type   and   Child class object.
Example :
Parent p = new Child();

Note :
* Can only access parent class methods.
* Can access child class overridden methods.

=====================================================================

Inheritance of Static Members :
* Inside child class we can access using parent class name.


Static method cannot be overridden :
* If you define a static method in the child class with the same signature as a static method in the parent class, it is not method overriding. Instead, it is called "method hiding".
* The method in the child class hides the method in the parent class, but both methods remain accessible depending on the reference type used to call them.


Examples :
class Parent {
    public static void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hello Parent");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    public static void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hello Child");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent.greet(); // Output: Hello Parent
        Child.greet();  // Output: Hello Child

        Parent obj = new Child();
        obj.greet();    // Output: Hello Parent (static method called based on reference type, not object type)
    }
}


=================================================================

Note :
We can't inherit parent static methode in child as instance methode.
