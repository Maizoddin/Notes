Polymorphism :
The ability of method to take multiple forms.

Function Prototype :
 return type
 functionName
 (arguments)

Function Signature :
 function name
 (arguments)

Types :
1] Compile time polymorphism  -  Method overloading :
   Two function with the same name but difference in arguments(num of arg || type of arg || order or arg).
   Same name but different signature.
   Return type doesn't matter.
   Methods can be in both child and parent.



2] Run time polymorphism  -  Method overriding :
   Two function with the same prototype but one should be in parent and one should be in child with different implementation.
   Child class method's access modifier can be less strict or equal to parent.
   Both should be of same type(either both should be static or both should be non static).
