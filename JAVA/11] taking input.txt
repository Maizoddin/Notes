classes which are there inside java.lang can be accessed directly without using import statement.
Example : System class


scanner class takes data from buffer and filters it and gives it to us.
We should pass System.in as an argument to it. System.in is an instance of InputStream, which reads raw bytes from the console and put's it into the buffer.

Example :
package backend;
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("ENTER YOU NAME AND AGE");
        String name = scanner.nextLine();
        int age = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Name : "+name+"\nAge : "+age);
    }
}

hasNext() : This methode checks whether buffer has specific value in it. if buffer is empty then waits for user to enter the value.

Methods of scanner :
next()                hasNext()
nextLine()            hasNextLine()              
nextInt()             hasNextInt()
nextBoolean()         hasNextBoolean()
nextFloat()           hasNextFloat()
nextLong()            hasNextLong()
