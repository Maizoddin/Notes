ReadWriteLock :

ReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();

Important :
1] Multiple threads can hold the read lock simultaneously.
2] Only one thread can hold the write lock at a time.
3] If a thread has a read lock, no thread can acquire a write lock until all read locks are released.
4] If a thread has a write lock, no other thread (reader or writer) can proceed.

Example :

ReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
lock.readLock().lock();
lock.readLock().unlock();
lock.writeLock().lock();
lock.writeLock().unlock();
