Download and Install JDK 
Go to system environment variable 
 1] Inside variable named as path add "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21\bin"    which points to our javac
 2] create new variable JAVA_HOME and add "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21"    which should point to our jdk setup 


jshell  -  It can be used for single line commands 

Java is platform independent,
High Level language,
Object oriented language

If we have c and c++ .exe file built on windows then we can't run it on mac because platform dependent.

Java is platform independet because of JVM(Java virtual machine).
JVM is platform dependent but java is platform independet.

Java SE(standard edition) - Core java
Java EE(enterprise edition) - Advance java
Java ME(Micro Edition)


Bydefault when we install jdk it comes with Java SE.
JDK contains JRE,  and JRE(Java Runtime Environment) contains JVM(Java Virtual Machine).

JDK contains javac, JRE.
JRE contains JVM
JVM contains JIT

JVM is a software that enables computer to run java program.
JVM contains JIT(Just in time compiler) which translates byte code into os specific machine code.

source code  (.java)
 javac(compiler)        ----       javac HelloWorld.java    (This will create a HelloWorld.class file  which contains byte code)
byte code(.class)
 jvm                     ----      java HelloWorld          (This will run our program which converts bytecode into machine code)
machine code  
 os
 hardware


If we have JRE then we can run the project which is having byte code. but we can't develop project.
