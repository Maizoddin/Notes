What is Lazy Initialization?
* By default, Spring eagerly initializes all beans at startup.
* Using @Lazy defers the creation of a bean until it is first requested.

Ways to enable Lazy Initialization
1] At Bean Level :
@Lazy
@Component
public class SwimCoach implements Coach { }

2] Global Setting (Recommended)
application.properties file
spring.main.lazy-initialization=true

Note : Lazy is useful only for singleton scope, because prototype scope will create instance only when requested so already lazy is applied there.

Note : While receiving lazy beans also we can use @Lazy.
Example :
Public class Hotel{
 public Hotel(@Lazy Order order){}
}

Note :
IF we use @Lazy while injecting then it injects the proxy object of that type
IF we use @Lazy on bean then it will create instance only when its being used and not when injected.
