Custom Component Scanning :
By default, component scanning happens in the main package and its sub-packages. 

To scan other packages:
@SpringBootApplication(scanBasePackages = {"com.example.package1", "com.example.package2"})

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@SpringBootApplication :
The @SpringBootApplication annotation is a combination of:

1] @EnableAutoConfiguration: Enables Spring Bootâ€™s auto-configuration.
2] @ComponentScan: Scans for components, configurations, and services.
3] @Configuration: Indicates that the class can be used as a source of bean definitions.
