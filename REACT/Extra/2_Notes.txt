React Version 18

React-DOM is used for WEB
React-Native is used for Mobile

React is a Libarary [It means it can be applied only to portion of our app as well. Example : If complete application is built using JQUERY then we can apply react only to our header]

In React we use JSX[JavaScript XML]

Approach to write React code:
1] Load the component
2] Fetch the data
3] Load again


=========================
Flow of Execution
Example 1] One Parent and one Child component
1] Parent component Loaded
2] Child component Loaded
3] Child component useEffect Called
4] Parent component useEffect called 

Example 2] One parent 2 child components
1] Parent component Loaded
2] Child-1 component Loaded
3] Child-2 component Loaded
4] Child-1 component useEffect Called
5] Child-2 component useEffect Called
6] Parent component useEffect called 

Note:
First react will load the component with default data and then it will call API and then it will update the DOM with new data.
As DOM updation is expensive opration react will batch it so that's the reason why in the above example react will batch useEffect of both Child-1 and Child-2 and then it will execute and update.
