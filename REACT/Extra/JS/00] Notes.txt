* this - keyword
In strict mode this refers to undefined.
In non-strict mode this refers to window object in browser and global object in node.

If variables are created globally using var outside of any function then they will be attached to window object. but not when created using let or const.

call, apply, bind does not work with arrow functions because "this" is fixed at the time the function is defined, not when it is called. 

But for normal functions "this" will be determined dynamically at run time based on the calling context.
