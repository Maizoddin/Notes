* While using CDN Links we should use React.createElement();
* We can't write JSX because there is no bundler and transpiler to convert JSX to React.createElement()

* React.createElement takes 3 arguments :
  a] Tag name
  b] Properties(Attributes)
  c] Children   Or array of children

* Note : 
  1] React.createElement creates js object and render methode converts that object into HTML tag. 
  2] If there is anything inside our root then render methode will replace that.
